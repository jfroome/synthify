	"description": "The MPC Studio merges real MPC pads, iconic workflow, and the same MPC Software used by the MPC Renaissance to give you a fully integrated portable production solution anywhere you can connect it to your computer.\n\nAkai Professional listened to four years of user feedback to find a way to improve the best-selling MPC Studio. Its still small, sturdy, and covered in features: 16 Genuine MPC pads and 4 Q-Link control knobs with MPC Note Repeat, Full Level, and 16 Level for inspirational workflow.\n\nBut the MPC Studio also has better knobs, scroll wheel, and the MPC Renaissances spun aluminum data dial so theyâ€™ll hold up even longer and give you a better feel during your performances.",
