	"title": "BOSS PC-2 Percussion Synthesizer (Used)",
	"description": "Let's take it back to 1984. It's a pedal. It's a drum pad. It's an analog synth. You want it. Whack it with a stick and get all kinds of sounds out of this thing. Alien bleep bloops, laser blasters and weirdness; but also deep bass drums, toms and more.\n\nVintage and used but in good shape. Works well. Can take a 9v battery or power supply (not included).",
