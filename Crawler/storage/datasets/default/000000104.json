	"title": "Parabola Solid State Tremolo (Used)",
	"description": "The PARABOLA is a solid state, transistor generated waveform tremolo. The oscillator is strongly influenced by the vintage Schaller TR-68/TR-316 “West Germany” tremolo pedals that CGC fell in love with in the 1990s. They have a gorgeous analog waveform that actually changes shape with the depth control, and a feel that is unlike anything they’d ever played before or since.",
