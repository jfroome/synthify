	"description": "SL Mk II has been designed to give you complete control over your music making software. We have worked with each of the main DAW manufacturers to make sure each of the 56 knobs, faders and buttons control the things in your software that you need them to control. However, the really clever bit is that SL MkII can directly control your plug-in instruments and FX (you also get an Italian made, semi-weighted keyboard mechanism).",
