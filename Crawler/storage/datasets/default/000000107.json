	"description": "The ProPitch Harmonizer from Eventide was top-of-the-line in its day in 1984, and today it's a beautiful piece of vintage digital goodness. Eventide's early mastery of digital signal processing and use of quality analog components means this machine has aged very gracefully. The controls are intuitive and straightforward, and you can get a wealth of sounds from the combination of pitch-shifting and delay; close flanging and phased doppler effects, shimmery ascending-pitch delays, and classic dubbed-out lo-fi delay when the fidelity is halved and the time doubled.\n\nThis unit has been thoroughly tested and is in great working condition. All features work asÂ expected with very little noise. Pots and faders are clean. There is some wear on the top panel, as pictured. It includes a standard IEC for power and a pair of TRS-XLR cables with polarity inverters, as the connections are polarity-reversed by default.",
