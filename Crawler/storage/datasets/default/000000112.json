	"description": "British invasion! Taking its roots from legendary British guitar amps, the English Muff'n recreates their majesty and classic tone with spot-on accuracy. Rather than approximating these amps like \"emulator\" products, the English Muff'n employs vacuum tubes to produce the richness and natural saturation of Brit-valve sounds. A bloody masterpiece!\nThis used item comes with the original box and power supply.\n",
