	"description": "An affordable recreation of the classic Roland TR-808, arguably the most iconic drum machine in history. This is a great way to get that classic sound without paying the premium required to own an original. The 808 helped shape the sound of hip-hop and electro, but also found its way into the mainstream through artists like Whitney Houston and Marvin Gaye.\n\nThis machine is in great working condition. It includes a power supply.",
