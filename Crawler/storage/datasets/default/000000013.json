	"description": "The CP-70 is an electric grand piano developed to deliver the depth of expression of an acoustic instrument while holding its own when performing on stage with electric guitars played at full volume through an amplifier and speakers.\nVery similar to a cut-down acoustic grand piano, the CP-70 features the same frame action and frame construction as an acoustic piano, but can be split into two cases for storage, and utilizes an electric guitar-style pickup system to pick up the sound for amplification via an amplifier.\nIts characteristic bright, edgy sound swept the music scene, with the CP-70 seeing extensive use in both live performance and recording scenarios.",
